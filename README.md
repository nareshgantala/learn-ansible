If changes made on an EC2 server are not getting pushed to GitHub, there are a few common issues that might be causing this. Here are some troubleshooting steps you can follow:

1. **Check Git Status:**
   Ensure that you have staged the changes you want to push. Run:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
   This will show you the current status of your repository and any changes that have not been staged.

2. **Stage the Changes:**
   If there are untracked or modified files, you need to stage them:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

3. **Commit the Changes:**
   Commit the staged changes with a descriptive message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   ```

4. **Check Remote URL:**
   Verify that the remote URL for the GitHub repository is set correctly:
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```
   If the URL is incorrect, you can set it using:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin <repository-url>
   ```

5. **Push the Changes:**
   Push the changes to the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
   Replace `main` with the appropriate branch name if you are using a different branch.

6. **Authentication Issues:**
   Ensure that you are authenticated properly. If you are using HTTPS, you might need to enter your GitHub username and personal access token. If you are using SSH, ensure that your SSH keys are configured correctly:
   - Check SSH keys:
     ```bash
     ssh-add -l
     ```
   - Add SSH key if necessary:
     ```bash
     ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
     ```
   - Test SSH connection to GitHub:
     ```bash
     ssh -T git@github.com
     ```

7. **Check for Errors:**
   If you encounter any errors during the push process, note the error messages. Common issues include network problems, authentication errors, or conflicts.

8. **Check Branch Names:**
   Ensure you are on the correct branch and pushing to the correct branch on GitHub:
   ```bash
   git branch
   ```

9. **Network Issues:**
   Ensure that your EC2 instance has internet access and can reach GitHub. You can check this by pinging GitHub:
   ```bash
   ping github.com
   ```

10. **Update Git:**
    Ensure that you are using a recent version of Git. If needed, update Git to the latest version.
